This is simply a storage for my practice projects mostly in <i>Python</i>. I am a PhD candidate in Public Policy, but <br> trying to learn Python for data exploration and analysis; and hopefully be able to secure a job if only a PhD doesn't cut it. I welcome any advice/feedback/life-coaching :) from fellow learners. Cheers!
